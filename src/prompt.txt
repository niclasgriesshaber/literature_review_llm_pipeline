Please only provide a summary if the paper is mentioning or using evaluation benchmarks.

If the paper is about evaluations, use the tag #evaluation at the beginning. This tag should be formatted in a way so Obsidian can read it properly.

Then, also summarise all numbers, such as accuracy, in the PDF related to the evaluation benchmarks. Explain the benchmark and how it works in detail afterward. 

If the paper is not related to evaluation benchmarks, just write "not about evaluations". Thank you.
